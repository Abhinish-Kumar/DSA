## What is array?
Array is a linear data Strucutre used in many algorithms to store similar types of data, and it store data with index number in the memory. In javascript index of the array starts with 0.

## Algorithms that uses Array data structure?

1. Store 10 random numbers and display. 
```javascript
let arr = [2,4,1,4,5,6,4,2,6,7];
for(let i=0;i<arr.length;i++){
console.log(arr[i]);
}
```

2. Return the lowest value in an array.

```javascript
let arr = [2,4,1,4,5,6,4,2,6,7];
let lowest = Infinity;
for(let i=0;i<arr.length;i++){
if(lowest>arr[i]){
lowest=arr[i];
}
}

console.log(lowest); //1
```

3. Bubble Sort

Lowest to highest

check two values and swap them

```javascript

let arr = [2,4,1,4,5,6,4,2,6,7];
for(let i=0;i<arr.length;i++){
if(lowest>arr[i]){

}
}

console.log(lowest); //1

```
