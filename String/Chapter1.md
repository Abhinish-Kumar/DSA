## Character set / ASCII code 

- Character set are the set of characters that are supported by a programming  language like c, c++ same  as characterSet supported by a computer system.
- Computer system work on a **Binary Number System** , So everything in a computer is a number. They do not support character.
- We define some set of numbers as charcters.
- For Every character we define some numeric value, So we give Some numeric code.
- For english alphabets for every character. There are some codes define those codes are standard codes.
- Every electronic machine follow that same set of code and thode codes are callled as the **American Standard Code for Information Interchange** (ASCII) given by ISO Standard.
- And for other languages we have UNICODEs

#### ASCII code for English language.

9 -- 57

```
All are symbols

Every Symbol in the keyboard defines a character set and for every keyboard there is same ASCII code available. 



Note :- we have total 128 ASCII codes

7 bits are sufficient =  ** 2^7 = 128  **

from **0---- 127**
